# ebay scam notice

Scammers will try to reach you where you least expect it, including by phone, email, or text message. Be suspicious of any unusual request for your personal or financial information. Don’t click on links that come from people you don’t know, and don’t respond. It’s safest just to delete these messages. Follow these tips to help you recognize and protect yourself from fraud and scams:

- Email phishing is one of the most common ways that people become victims of financial fraud, ransomware, or worse. Be suspicious of any email that promises a deal that is too good to be true, demands you take immediate action, includes attachments or links, or asks you for personal information. Never click on a link or open a file in an email unless you are absolutely certain that you know the sender and that the message itself makes sense.

- Never open or download files attached to emails you aren’t expecting, even if they seem to come from people or businesses you know. These attachments can infect your system with malware that can steal your personal information, take money from your accounts, buy things on your account, and send scam emails to all your email contacts!

- Watch out for pop-ups that tell you that you need to verify account information, click a link, or download software. When in doubt, close your browser and type in the company’s URL or use a familiar bookmark.

- Scammers will try to reach you where you least expect it, including by text. Don’t click on links that come from people you don’t know, and don’t respond. It’s safest just to delete these messages.

- Don’t respond to phone requests for your account information either. eBay will never ask you for your password or financial information over the phone.
